# hello-world
My first repository

Hi, reader!

I'm following the github's guide so I can learn I little more about being part of a community like this.
I wanna learn how to code, cause I'm venturing into this new exciting world of digital marketing and web development. I need skills. I know nearly nothing about all that, but I'm a good student.
